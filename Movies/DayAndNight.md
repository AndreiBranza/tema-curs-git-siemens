# DayAndNight - A Tale Of Lost Love And Found Powers

![poster](./../Images/DayAndNightMoviePoster.jpg)

In a world were morals became obsolote and picking your nose in public was the new norm, two superpowered persons battle on two fronts: who cleans the house and whether there should be day or night (*in a close range around them*).
Who will win?   
A smelly breath or easily discouraged personality?   
Only nobody will tell.  
They are: **SHADOW MAN** and **LIGHT WOMAN** *laser sounds* *action movie explosions*
