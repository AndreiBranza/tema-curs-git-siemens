# The Undressed Hero

![poster](./../Images/TheUndressedHero.jpg)

Inviseeble felt like doing something bad one day. He went invisible and then realised he doesn't seem to find his weapon. While waiting for his power to recharge, HitAll recieved a call: Inviseeble was going to rob a bank. Our hero managed to leave his house without losing his clothes but when trying to enter villain's hub, luck went missing. After hitting the walls for a few times, the hero got inside, but without clothes. Miraculously, his clothes ended on Inviseeble. This way, HitAll could see where the villain was and could fight him.
