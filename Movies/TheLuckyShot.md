# The Lucky Shot

![poster](./../Images/luckyShot.jpg)

February 2017. On her way home from school, Evelina sadly remembers how her classmates bullied her during a break. In the afternoon, while she was in the yard trying to hit some bottles, a fugitive on a bicycle rushed past the house followed by the police. She grabbed her bow and ran in the direction they were headed. Apparently the Phone Ranger robbed the town bank again, using his new alien technology.
